//! # Brutal Exploit Tests
//!
//! These tests are UNFORGIVING. Failure is failure.
//!
//! ## Categories:
//! - `legit_vs_fake` - Spoofing detection: Can the system tell real from fake?
//! - `under_pressure` - Concurrent attacks: Does the system survive chaos?
//! - `breach_isolation` - Container isolation: If one dies, do others survive?
//! - `crash_recovery` - System failures: Graceful degradation or panic?
//! - `block_storage` - Block Storage (qc-02) security: Assembler attacks, integrity, authorization
//! - `block_propagation` - Block Propagation (qc-05) security: Rate limiting, oversized blocks, gossip attacks
//! - `ipc_authentication` - IPC security: HMAC forgery, replay attacks, timestamp manipulation
//! - `merkle_proofs` - Merkle proof tampering: Tree construction, proof verification attacks
//! - `state_management` - State Management (qc-04) security: Trie corruption, proof bypass, race conditions
//! - `bloom_filters` - Bloom Filters (qc-07) security: Privacy fingerprinting, FPR manipulation, IPC violations
//! - `consensus` - Consensus (qc-08) security: Attestation forgery, PBFT attacks, validator manipulation
//! - `finality` - Finality Gadget (qc-09) security: Circuit breaker bypass, slashing detection, threshold manipulation
//! - `api_gateway` - API Gateway (qc-16) security: Rate limit bypass, RLP garbage, auth timing attacks
//! - `zero_day` - Zero-Day attacks: ALL SUBSYSTEMS brutal real-world attack simulations
